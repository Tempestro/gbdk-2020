### Overview of Licenses in GBDK-2020

See the relevant licensing files in the LICENSES folder for details on the entries below


### For the End User
Q: What license information is required when distributing the compiled ROM (binary) of my game?

A: There is no requirement to include or credit any of the GBDK-2020 licenses or authors, although credit of GBDK-2020 is appreciated.
   This is different and separate from redistributing the GBDK-2020 dev environment itself (or the GBDK-2020 sources) which does require the licenses.

GPLv2+LE (linking exception). Some files from SDCC, some from the historical GBDK that were originally LGPL and have been relicensed to GPLv2+LE (linking exception) to match the SDCC ones in 2022 by permission of original authors.
